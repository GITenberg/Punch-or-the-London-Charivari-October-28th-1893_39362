<h2>A DIARY À LA RUSSE.</h2>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Rather tired of this constant hand-shaking, and even
the lady-kissing is somewhat wearisome. Especially when the fair
dames do not draw the line at sixty. However, no doubt well meant.
Found usual collection of miscellaneous presents. Don't quite know
what I shall do with ton of tallow. Somehow our hosts fancy we
require it. Latest addition from the advertising merchants&mdash;a
Patent Tombstone (with space for <i>affiches</i> at back) and Somebody's
Remedy for Neuralgia. Wish our hosts would not send us such a
lot of things! Have been staying at my hotel all day long on the
chance of escaping attention, and thus be able to find my way to the
Moulin Rouge. Just got past the porter, when I was caught by one
of the <i>attachés</i> and carried off to a State Dinner. Spent the rest of
the evening in shouting "Long Live France!" and listening to the
Russian National Hymn.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Hope I shall have better luck to-day. My hand is
twice its normal size, thanks to the shaking. More presents.
Candles by the hundredweight, and bear's-grease by the ton. Some
one has sent a Boot-blacking Machine, and wants a testimonial. On
the watch all day. Trust to get to the Folies Bergères some time or
another. Just crawled out when seized by a friendly <i>député</i>, and
hurried off to a function at the Hotel de Ville!</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Absolutely done up. Deafened with the "<i>Marseillaise</i>,"
and sick to death of "<i>The Emperor's Hymn</i>." Usual
collection of presents. Five thousand fire-alarms! One of them
alone enough to wake up a slumbering town of half a million inhabitants!
Ladies of all ages (especially of mature age) anxious to
kiss me. Could not walk across the road this morning for them!
Had to stop in the hotel all day long. Tried to escape in the evening
on the chance of finding my way to a "concert-music-hall," when
seized by an officer of the French Marine, and carried away to a Reception!</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;I have now been in Paris four days and seen
nothing, absolutely nothing! Of course most gratifying from a
patriotic point of view, but if this is Paris why give me St. Petersburg,
or even Siberia! Can't move a step without having my hand shaken
off. Not a moment's privacy; and as for the presents, I am absolutely
deluged with them! and such idiotic gifts! All the advertisers
in the country seem to have found us out. What use on earth
can I make of an elephant's feeding-spoon or a lady's comb for curling
the hair? I made a last effort to get to the Moulin; but, of course,
again frustrated. I was seized by an "A.-D.-C." and taken to a State Lecture!</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Giving way to despair! What a hollow thing is popular
applause! I am absolutely tired to death of it. I cannot repeat
(for very weariness), the various ovations I have received. I have
been accepted with cheers at all hours of the day and night! Oh,
how glad I would be to get back! At the last moment I saw my
way to a stealthy visit to the Folies, when I was secured and booked
for two dinners and a "<i>punch</i>." Betrayed! Betrayed!</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Still hunted. Not allowed to go anywhere except
when my tormentors drag me to some official function. Have sold all
my presents for ten francs. Have received marching orders for
Toulon. Just as I was about to escape and proceed to the Moulin
Rouge, captured by "my friends the enemy," or should it be "my
enemies the friends"? Had to submit to the usual enthusiasm on my
road to the railway station. Fortune of war I suppose, or rather of
peace. Of the two, the latter I should think was the more deadly.
Last strain of the "<i>Marseillaise</i>," last kiss from some one's grandmother,
and curtain! Glad it's all over!</p>

<h2>UNDER THE ROSE.</h2>

<h4>(<i>A Story in Scenes.</i>)</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Scene</span> XI.&mdash;<i>At the entrance to The Eldorado Music-hall.</i>
<span class="sc">Time</span>&mdash;<i>Saturday
evening, about</i> 8.30. Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey</span>, <i>who has just
alighted from a Waterloo bus, approaches; she wears a veil,
under which her spectacles gleam balefully, and passes the
various boards and coloured posters with averted eyes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toovey</i> (<i>to herself</i>). I'm late&mdash;I ought to have taken a cab,
instead of that dawdling bus. Still, I shall be in plenty of time to
surprise Pa in the very midst of his profligacy. (<i>She looks around
her.</i>) Gilding, rosewood and mahogany panels, plush, stained glass&mdash;oh,
the wicked luxury of it all! (<i>She pushes open a swing door.</i>)
Where is the place you call Box C? I&mdash;I have to meet somebody there.</p>

<p class="ind2">
[<i>She finds herself in a glittering bar, where she produces a
distinct sensation among a few loungers there.</i>
</p>

<p><i>A Barmaid</i> (<i>tartly</i>). There's no entrance to the music-hall this
<ins title="T.N.: Original reads 'wav'">way</ins>. You've come to the wrong place.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>with equal acidity</i>). Ah, young woman, you need not
tell me <i>that</i>! (<i>She goes out with
a withering glance, and hears
stifled sniggers as the doors swing
after her.</i>) A drinking-bar on the
very threshold to trap the unwary&mdash;disgraceful!
(<i>She tries the next door, and finds a stalwart
official, in a fancy uniform.</i>)
Will you have the goodness to
conduct me to Box C, instantly?</p>

<p><i>The Official.</i> Next door, please,
Ma'am. This only admits to the Grand Lounge.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). The
"Grand Lounge," indeed! (<i>She
opens another door, and finds a
Pay-box, where she addresses the
check-taker through the pigeon-hole</i>.) I want to go to Box C.
I've asked for it at I don't know how many places, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Checktaker</i> (<i>politely</i>). I'm
really afraid you'll have to ask
again, Ma'am. This is the Promenade.
Box-office <i>next</i> entrance.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself, indignantly</i>). I only hope they make it
as difficult for other people to get
in as they do for me! So Pa
comes here to lounge and promenade, does he? Oh, let me only
catch him, I'll send him promenading!
(<i>She goes to the Box-office.</i>)
I want Box C, wherever that is.</p>

<p><i>Book-Keeper.</i> Can give you
Box D, if you like. Box C is
reserved for this evening.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>sharply</i>). I am
quite aware of that. For Mr.
<span class="sc">Theophilus Toovey</span>. I have come to join him here.</p>

<p><i>Book-K.</i> (<i>referring to book</i>). It
is entered in that name, certainly;
but&mdash;hem&mdash;may I ask if you belong to Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey's</span> party?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>crushingly</i>). No doubt you consider that his wife has
no claim to&mdash;&mdash; Most certainly I belong to his party.</p>

<p><i>Book-K.</i> That is quite sufficient, Madam. (<i>To</i> Attendant.) Show
this lady to Box C. (<i>To himself, as</i> Mrs. T. <i>follows the</i> Attendant
<i>up some velvet-covered stairs</i>.) Well, it's no business of mine; but
if Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey</span>, whoever <i>he</i> is, isn't careful what he's about, he
may be sorry for it&mdash;that's all!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). They never even asked for my ticket.
Pa's evidently well known here! (<i>To</i> Attendant.) A programme?
with pictures of dancing girls all over it! You ought to be
ashamed to offer such things to a respectable woman!</p>

<p><i>Att.</i> (<i>surprised</i>). I've never heard them objected to before, Ma'am.
Can I bring you any refreshments? (<i>Persuasively.</i>) Bottle-ale or
stout? Lemonade and brandy? Whisky and soda?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Don't imagine you can tempt <i>me</i>, man. I've been a
total abstainer ever since I was five!</p>

<p><i>Att.</i> (<i>opening box-door</i>). Indeed, Ma'am. I suppose now you 'aven't
mistook this for Exeter 'All?&mdash;because it <i>ain't</i>!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> I am in no danger of making <i>that</i> mistake! (<i>She
enters the box.</i>) I am here before Pa after all. What a gaudy,
wicked, glaring place to be sure! Ugh, this <i>filthy</i> tobacco; it chokes
me, and I can scarcely see across the hall. Not that I <i>want</i> to see.
Well, if I sit in the corner behind the curtain I shan't be seen
myself. To think that I&mdash;<i>I</i>&mdash;should be here at all, but the responsibility
is on Pa's head, not mine! What are those two girls
singing about on the stage? They are dressed <i>decently</i> enough, I'll
say <i>that</i> for them, though pinafores and baby bonnets at <i>their</i> age
are ridiculous.</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>She listens.</i>
</p>

<p><i>The Sisters Sarcenet</i> (<i>on stage</i>). You men are deceivers and awfully sly. Oh, you <i>are</i>!</p>
<p><i>Male portion of audience</i> (<i>as is expected from them</i>). No we <i>aren't!</i></p>
<p><i>The Sisters S.</i> (<i>archly</i>). Now you <i>know</i> you are!</p>

<div class="poem2">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">You come home with the milk; should your poor wife ask why,</p>
<p class="i4">"Pressing business, my pet!" you serenely reply.</p>
<p class="i4">When you've really been out on the "Tiddle-y-hi!" Yes, you <i>have</i>!</p>
</div>  </div>

<p><i>Male audience</i> (<i>as before</i>). No, we've <i>not</i>!</p>
<p><i>The Sister S.</i> (<i>with the air of accusing angels</i>). Why, you <i>know</i> you have!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). It's to those young women's credit that
they have the courage to come here and denounce the men to their
faces&mdash;like this. And it's gone
<i>home</i> to them, too! they're shouting out "Over!" (<i>Here the
Sisters suddenly turn a couple of
"cart-wheels" with surprising
unanimity, amidst roars of applause.</i>)
Oh, the shameless minxes!
I will <i>not</i> sit and look on at such
scandalous exhibitions. (<i>She
moves to the corner nearest the
stage, and turns her back upon
the proceedings.</i>) How much
longer will Pa compel me to assist
at such scenes, I wonder? <i>Why</i>
doesn't he come? Where is he
now? (<i>Bitterly.</i>) No doubt on
what those vulgar wretches
would call the "Tiddle-y-hi!"
(<i>The</i> Brothers <span class="sc">Bimbo</span>, <i>Eccentric
Clowns, appear on the stage</i>.) I
can't sit here in a corner looking
at nothing. If I do see anything
improper, <span class="sc">Theophilus</span> shall
answer for it. (<i>She changes her
place again.</i>) Acrobats&mdash;well,
they're inoffensive at least. Oh,
I do believe one of the nasty things
is climbing up to the balcony;
he's going to walk along here!</p>

<p><i>First Brother Bimbo</i> (<i>on stage,
to his confrère, who is balancing
himself on the broad ledge of the
box tier</i>). Ohè&mdash;'old up, there.
Prenny garde! Ah, il tombera!
There, I <i>told</i> yer so! (<i>The</i>
Second Brother B. <i>has reached
the front of</i> Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey's</span> <i>box,
where he pretends to stumble</i>.)
Oh, le pover garçong, look at
'im <i>now</i>! Come back, do! Ask
the lady to ketch 'old of your trousers be'ind!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to the</i> Second
Brother, <i>firmly</i>). Don't expect
me to do anything of the sort. Go back, as your brother asks you
to, you silly fellow. You shouldn't attempt such a foolhardy thing at all!</p>

<p><i>Second Br. B.</i> (<i>to the</i> First). Oh, my! There's <i>such</i> a nice
young lady in here; she's asking me to come in and set along with
her! <i>May</i> I?</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>He lets himself drop astride the ledge, and wags his head at</i>
Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey</span>, <i>to her intense horror</i>.
</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>in an audible undertone</i>). If you don't take away
that leg at once, I'll pinch it!</p>

<p><i>Second Br. B.</i> Eh? Not <i>now</i>; my brother says I mustn't.
"Come round afterwards?" Well, well, we'll see! (<i>He springs up
on the ledge again, and kisses his hand to her.</i>) Goo'bye, ducky!
'Ave no fears for <i>me</i>. Whoo-up!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/196-1000.png"><img src="images/196-400.png" width="400" height="523" alt="'Goo'bye, ducky! Ave no fears for me!'" /></a>
<p class="center">"Goo'bye, ducky! Ave no fears for <i>me</i>!"</p></div>

<p class="ind2">[<i>He continues his tour of the balcony, amidst roars of laughter.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>falling back in the box, speechless with fury</i>). And
<i>this</i> is the treatment Pa exposes me to&mdash;all those unmanly wretches
laughing at me! But I don't care; here I stay till Pa comes.
<i>Oh</i>, this smoke; I shall be poisoned by it soon! Upon my word,
there's a bold hussy coming on to sing, in a man's coat and black satin
knee-breeches. I'll stop my ears; they shall see there's <i>one</i> woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg 197]</span>
here who respects herself! (<i>She does so, during that and the subsequent
performances; an hour passes.</i>) How much longer am I to
be compelled to remain here? This is terrible; three creatures in
tight red suits, got up to look like devils! I wonder they've no
fear of being struck dead on the stage! They're standing on each
other's stomachs. I daren't look on at such blasphemy! I'll take
off my spectacles; then, at least, my eyes won't be offended by
seeing anything distinctly! (<i>She removes her glasses, and replaces
them in their case, which she lays on the box-ledge.</i>) They're
gone, thank goodness. What's this? There's someone opening the
box-door. Pa&mdash;at last! Well, I'm ready for him!</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>She stiffens in her chair.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Attendant's Voice</i> (<i>outside</i>). This is Box C, Miss. Can I bring
you any refreshments? Bottle-ale, stout, lemonade, Miss?</p>

<p><i>A Female Voice.</i> I&mdash;I don't know. There's a gentleman with
me; he'll be here directly; he only stopped to speak to somebody.
Ah, he's coming now.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> "Miss"?! This is Pa's party, then. <i>Oh!!</i></p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>A quietly dressed, and decidedly good-looking girl enters, and
starts on seeing that the box is already occupied.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>rising in towering wrath</i>). You were not expecting to
find <i>me</i> here, Miss, I've no doubt?</p>

<p><i>The Girl</i> (<i>sitting down</i>). No; <span class="sc">Phil</span> didn't say there would
be anyone else; but any friend of his I'm sure&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> <span class="sc">Phil</span>? you dare to call him "<span class="sc">Phil</span>!" Do you
know who I am, you insolent girl, you? I am his Wife!</p>

<p><i>The Girl.</i> His wife? I don't believe it. Are you sure you don't
mean his mother. My <i>Phil</i> married to <i>you</i>, indeed&mdash;a pretty story!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>trembling with rage</i>). Go out of this box instantly, or
I'll make you!</p>

<p><i>The Girl.</i> I shall do nothing of the kind. Wait till my friend
comes, and we'll soon&mdash;&mdash;(<i>As the door opens.</i>) <span class="sc">Phil, Phil</span>, here's
an abusive old female here who pretends she is your wife, and wants
to order me out. I believe she must either be intoxicated or out of her senses!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>pouncing upon the newcomer and boxing his ears
soundly</i>). Is she? it is you who are out of <i>your</i> senses, Pa! Take
that&mdash;and <i>that</i>&mdash;and now come home with me, do you hear?</p>

<p><i>The Newcomer</i> (<i>with his hand to his cheek</i>). "Pa," am I? I
thought I was your <i>husband</i> just now! Well, I must have married
before I was born, either way. And now, perhaps, you'll explain
what all this means?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>faintly</i>). Oh, my goodness! I've made a dreadful
mistake; it <i>isn't</i> Pa! Let me go&mdash;let me go!</p>

<p><i>The Newc.</i> (<i>putting his back against the door</i>). Not yet, Ma'am;
not yet. You don't go like this; after insulting this young lady, to
whom I've the honour of being engaged, and telling her you're my
wife, and then smacking my face in her presence. I've my dignity
to consider, and I want satisfaction out of you. Come, we won't
have a row here, for the sake of this young lady; just step out into
lobby here, and I'll give you in charge for assault. Stay where you
are, <span class="sc">Milly</span>, my dear. Now, Ma'am, will you go, or shall I send for
a constable? (Mrs. T. <i>totters out, protesting incoherently, and begging
to be released</i>.) Well, I don't want to spoil my evening's pleasure
on your account. You give me your name and address, and I'll
simply summon you for assault; which is more than you deserve.
If you won't, I'll charge you!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>reluctantly</i>). Oh, indeed it was an acc&mdash;&mdash;I will
<i>not</i> give you my name. Yes, yes, I will; anything to get out of this
horrible place. (<i>The young man produces a pencil, and pulls down
his left shirt cuff.</i>) Mrs.&mdash;<span class="sc">Too</span>&mdash;no, I don't mean
<span class="sc">Too&mdash;Tomkinson
Jones</span>&mdash;The&mdash;the Laburnums&mdash;U&mdash;upper Tooting. There, <i>now</i> are
you satisfied?</p>

<p><i>The Young Man</i> (<i>recording it</i>). Thank you, that's all <i>I</i>
require. You'll hear from me later on. Good evening!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>as she crawls down the staircase</i>). I have only just
saved myself by a&mdash;a <i>fib</i>! And I haven't even found Pa out. But I
<i>will</i>. I'll go straight home and sit up for him!</p>

<h3>FRAGMENTS FROM A FRANCO-RUSSIAN PHRASE-BOOK.</h3>

<h4>(<i>Picked up at Toulon after the recent Fêtes.</i>)</h4>

<h3>AT THE BANQUET.</h3>

<p>I am glad to be next to a Russian. Believe me, France has
always been the best friend of Russia.... No, <i>that</i> was not France&mdash;it
was the Corsican. Altogether a different thing.... <i>Were</i> we
at the Crimea? It is possible&mdash;through the perfidy of those
English.... Try some of this old sherry. Your shark-fin soup is
delicious.... As I was saying, we are a Republic now, and adore
Liberty.... Siberia must be a charming place, and the climate
ravishing. You have never been there? A pleasure to come!...
Take a <i>carafe</i> of <ins title="T.N.: Original reads 'champage'">champagne</ins>&mdash;there is plenty more. We are a democratic
nation, and the hearts of our populace go out to an autocrat.
I know well that all autocrats are not nice&mdash;but <i>yours!!</i> <i>Do</i>
have some more champagne.... These are <i>Cailles Schuvaroff</i>.
They are Russian&mdash;so they <i>must</i> be good!... Do you know that
my wife and I kissed the hands of (<i>ten&mdash;fifteen&mdash;fifty&mdash;two hundred</i>)
Russian sailors through the portholes of your flagship this afternoon?...
Not at all&mdash;we quite enjoyed it.... There is a proposal
to present your Admiral with a model of the Tour Eiffel in brilliants.
I remember it was exhibited in Paris at a franc for admission&mdash;but
few people went. I wish he may get it. I subscribed ten
(<i>Napoleons&mdash;francs&mdash;centimes</i>) towards the fund for presenting
commemorative brooches to the wives, daughters, and sweethearts
of your seamen. I hope they will all arrive quite safely.... Have
you received a silver cup with a suitable inscription? Only a
yellow champagne-glass with a motto! That is mean, miserable,
shabby! I will speak to a waiter about it.... Why do you not
drink? Fill your glass. I am filling mine.... Have you heard
that our warm-hearted nation has forwarded to the Russian Fleet
one hundred cases of the best blacking? The Triple Alliance is
trembling in its shoes.... You drink nothing! All the same, it
seems to me your Tsar might have sent <i>more</i> ships while he
was about it. Yes, I repeat; more&mdash;and bigger ones. It would
have been more polished. But you Russians are <i>not</i> polished;
you are cold, brutal, phlegmatic. You remind me of an Englishman
I once saw on the stage of the Variétés. But he had red
whiskers, and said, "Aoh, yes!" You drink too much. The
Russians are all intemperate&mdash;it is the climate. So long as you
help us to our revenge, we do not care <i>what</i> you are. I speak
quite frankly. This is a great day for France. As a Frenchman,
I shall never see caviar again without a thrill of heartfelt emotion.
But your shark-fin soup was disgusting&mdash;beastly. It is that which
is making me so ill.... <i>Au revoir</i>, dear friend. I am going under
the table for a little while&mdash;to think.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p><i>Barabbas</i> is a romance by <span class="sc">Marie Corelli</span>, founded upon the
narrative given by the Four Evangelists. It is in three volumes, and
<i>Barabbas</i> is the principal character. Oratorios have been composed
musically illustrating the sacred story, mystery plays there
have been showing it forth in action, but never yet have we been
taken, as it were, behind the scenes, introduced to <span class="sc">Judas Iscariot's</span>
sister, and been informed as to the motives of human action underlying
"the World's Tragedy." Whether "the stock of <i>Barabbas</i>"
hath been sold out or not, the Baron cannot imagine that this novel
form of treating Holy Writ will ever be popular with any section
of our ordinary reading public. <span class="sc">Marie Corelli</span> is a writer as
picturesque as prolific, but she has wasted her time and talents on
this romance. There used to be a perversion of the text, which
took this form, "Now <span class="sc">Barabbas</span> was&mdash;a publisher" (was it <span class="sc">Sydney
Smith's</span> jest?); but if that applies nowadays, the publisher who
depended solely upon this particular work for his success would,
probably, far nearer resemble <span class="sc">Zaccheus</span> than <span class="sc">Barabbas</span>, inasmuch
as he might find himself "up a tree."</p>

<p><i>Catriona</i> is written by R. L. <span class="sc">Stevenson</span>, and published in one
volume by <span class="sc">Cassell &amp; Co</span>. "Aweel, aweel, mon!" quoth the Baron,
after several praiseworthy attempts at mastering the Scotch dialect
in which the story is told; "aweel, aweel! I am swier to leave ye,
<i>Catriona</i>! But it maun be as it will; I'm nane sae muckle learned
in your Scotch tongue; sae I'll e'en put doun the book, or I'll be
wearyful, deil hae 't!" No: Scotch the Baron cannot manage&mdash;except
taken as whiskey. But he will tell those who love the language
that <span class="sc">McStevenson's</span> <i>Catriona</i> they will enjoy to their heart's
content.
All the same it remains a mystery to the Baron de B. W.</p>

<h2>A WALK IN DEVON.</h2>

<h3>PART I.&mdash;THE START.</h3>

<h4><i>Notes from the Travel Diary of Toby, M.P.</i></h4>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><i>The Cottage, Burrow-in-the-Corner, Devon.</i></p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Went out for a walk just now; nothing remarkable in that; the
wonder came in when I got back. Present postal address given
at head of this note. The Cottage is there all right, but where
the township, hamlet, village, or whatever Burrow-in-the-Corner
may be, is situated, haven't the least idea, and I've tramped
pretty well round the country. The Cottage stands at four cross
roads, on the top of a hill. Specks in the distance, in the valley
and on the hillsides, understood to be farm-houses. Three miles
off is Tipperton; it is approached from this point by a steep hill:
most convenient way of getting to bottom is to lie down on top
and roll; some people said to have become adepts in practise; can
even enjoy quiet sleep on the way, and pull up at the very shop
in High Street where they have business. So it is said; but I
rarely see any people about Burrow-in-the-Corner; so how can
they approach Tipperton in this or other way? The only persons
that pass The Cottage palings are men who stop to ask their way.
The population is sparse, and seems to fill up its time by losing
itself. This should have been a warning to me, but it wasn't.</p>

<p>The Cottage been standing here for at least two hundred years.
Began life as a smithy; only recently retired from business.
The initials of one of its tenants are "R. B." He has carved the
letters on the front door, with the date, 1813, following it. Fancy
he must have been pretty old then, for, two years later, he cuts
his initials again with date 1815; the writing quite shakey;
possibly he had heard of Waterloo, and his hand was tremulous
with patriotic joy. On second thought, that improbable. News of
Waterloo not likely to have reached Burrow-in-the-Corner within
limit of twelve months.</p>

<p>The smithy still stands as "R. B." left it when his bellows
blew their last gasp. The Cottage itself transformed. The thatched
roof remains; also the whitewashed walls, the porch, the little windows
embayed in thick walls, which quite naturally form window-seats,
where, if you take care not to bang your head, you may sit
at ease, and look out over the swelling upland&mdash;rich red where it
has just been ploughed; for the most part green pastures trending
down to the Exe, a silver stream, rippling on to the sea, reckless
of all it will pass through before it joins it. We have a parlour,
but prefer to sit in the kitchen, a dainty room with gleaming dark-red
sideboard; a kitchener, polished to distraction, so that looking-glasses
are superfluities; a piano in recess by fireplace; a chimney-piece,
on which gleam copper pans, brass candlesticks, and pewter
plates, with their initials and ancient birth-dates polished almost
out of sight; white-curtained windows, bright with begonias and
cyclamen; a low ceiling, supported by a pragmatical beam, strictly
conforming to the regulation that forbids a straight line in the room.</p>

<p>Have discovered that kitchen is best place in house to dine in;
only drawback is that everything served so unexpectedly hot,
new-comers scald themselves. Soon grow used to it, and to get
grilled mushrooms served really hot is compensation for inconvenience.
As for pancakes (made with freshly-laid eggs), begin
to think I never tasted the real delicacy before. Your true pancake,
as <span class="sc">Brillat-Savarin</span> omitted to say in his well-known treatise,
should be eaten to the music of the one in the pan preparing to
follow. When we go back to town, mean to ask servants to sit in
dining-room whilst we dine in kitchen.</p>

<p>When I speak of going back to town, of course I imply the
certainty of being able to find our way out of Burrow-in-the-Corner
to nearest railway station.</p>

<p>Seems a good deal to have four cross roads all to yourself at your
front door. The Cottage scarcely of sufficient importance to justify
such lavish accommodation. But in these parts the amount of arable
land wasted in roads and lanes is almost criminal. It was a Saturday
evening when I went out to find the post-office. Nothing
seemed plainer than instructions.</p>

<p>"Go straight down the road facing you, and you'll come to a
church. Close by it is a house; letter-box inserted in side of house;
box painted red, you know."</p>

<p>Of course I knew; set off with a light heart and handful of
letters. A little way down high road, on right-hand side, lane
suddenly opened and delved downwards, its sinuous course
embowered in trees; where they failed, barricaded with hedges.
High road seemed originally bent upon taking this direction;
changed its mind; turned abruptly to left. Suppose a few traps
driven down hill must occasionally have taken this dip; feeble
attempt to avoid too frequent recurrence of accident made by setting
posts on line of high road, and painting tops white. If, after this,
anyone on pitch-dark night mistakes road, only themselves to blame.
Other roads and lanes perplexingly branching out to right and left
at short intervals; kept on steadily till church came in view; found
the house; not difficult, as there was only one; also discovered
letter-box painted red. Twenty minutes to five was hour for
clearing box; barely that; posted letters. Turning away when
observed remark on letter-box, "Next collection Monday."</p>

<p>Pretty go, this; postman evidently been before his time; no sign
of him on wide expanse. Looking round perceived Elderly Gentleman
sitting in garden behind house; doubtless this was the householder;
apparently had anticipated Sunday by putting on best
clothes; black frock coat, getting brown about the seams; high
collar, nearly covering black stock; black waistcoat, which seemed
to belong to other suit than the coat; (was buttoned close up over
stock, whilst coat, with generous lapels folded back, buttoned low
down); brown trousers, a little short in leg; stout green umbrella
under left arm. Elderly Gentleman was sitting on rustic bench,
with cup of cider at hand, and expression of serene content on his
wrinkled face. A quaintly-coloured cup, with two handles close
together, presumably with view to taking a good pull at contents.
"Bin my grandfather's," he said, looking at it with affection, and
incidentally half emptying it. There was a motto roughly scrawled
by the potter; Elderly Gentleman read it to me:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">    Erth I am et es most trew,</p>
<p class="i10">    Disdain me not for so be yew.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Thus it was spelled, but no one born out of Devon could convey
the tremendous sound of the <i>u</i> in the rhyming words. This peculiar
to the soil; even barndoor fowls have it; notice that gamecock at The
Cottage when it wakes me early in the morning, always shrilly pipes
"cock-a-doodle-<i>dew</i>!" Asked Elderly Gentleman if he lived here?
Born in the house, he said. Was he going for a walk? No, only
sitting about. Then why the umbrella? Ah! he always took it out
of drawer with his Sunday clothes, and put it under his arm, if he
was only sitting in the garden.</p>

<p>But that's another story, told me after we had caught the postman.</p>

<h2>"THE ART OF 'SAVOY FARE.'"</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">D'Oyly Carte</span> is to be heartily congratulated on his brilliant
mounting of Messrs. <span class="sc">Gillivan</span> and <span class="sc">Sulbert's</span> most recent
production
entitled <i>Utopia (Limited)</i>. "Limited" it is in more senses than one.
As there was, according to the immortal <i>Cyrus Bantam, M.C.</i>,
when he was giving his information to <i>Mr. Pickwick</i>, "nobody old
or ugly in Ba-ath," so there is on "the spindle side" no one old or
ugly on the stage of the Savoy Theatre. And this, too, with a
difference, applies to Sir <span class="sc">Arthur's</span> music, in which if there be
nothing particularly new&mdash;and the old familiar friends receive the
heartiest welcome&mdash;there is at all events nothing dull, even though
it may "hardly ever" rise above mere commonplace. Occasionally
there is a snatch of sweet melody that brings to mind the composer's
happiest inspirations, whether in oratorio or burlesque.</p>

<p>As to dramatic plot&mdash;well, strictly speaking, there is none;
and it would be difficult to name a single telling "situation," in
<i>Utopia (Limited)</i>. The Monarch of Utopia wishes to introduce
English customs into his kingdom; there is a court party
opposed to this innovation: that's the essence of it. In the First Act
the one hit, is the introduction of <i>Captain Corcoran</i> from <i>The
Pinafore</i>
of years ago, and the repetition of the once popular catch-phrase
about "What never?" <ins title="T.N.: Original reads 'aRd'">and</ins> "Hardly ever," which, taken as
applying to our most recent tragical ironclad disaster, is thoroughly
appreciated. Beyond this, as far as dialogue and music go, in the
First Act there is very little anyone would care to "carry away
with him" after a first visit. And if that little were carried away
the residuum would offer scant attraction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/204-1000.png"><img src="images/204-600.png" width="600" height="462" alt="The Union of Arts. 'Again we come to thee,'" /></a>
<h4><span class="sc">The Union of Arts</span>. "Again we come to thee,
Savoy."&mdash;<i>Old Duet.</i></h4></div>

<p>As for the Second Act, with its Royal Drawing-room scene, its
splendid costumes, and its mimicry of Court etiquette, have we not
witnessed a similar spectacle on a larger scale in a Drury Lane
Pantomime, not so very many years ago? And was not that arranged
by the same artistic stage-manager, who is now, by a wise dispensation
of theatrical providence, in command at the Savoy, yclept
Mr. <span class="sc">Charles Harris</span>? I fancy the Drury Lane Pantomime had the
best of it in point of broad fun, as, if I remember right, <span class="sc">Herbert
Campbell</span> was the Queen, and <span class="sc">Harry Nicholls</span> the King. Before
this scene is the principal hit of the Second Act, when the King,
Mr. <span class="sc">Barrington</span>,&mdash;to whom author and composer are under considerable
obligations for the success of the piece, and without
whose acting, dancing, and singing the entertainment would fare
indifferently well,&mdash;with his counsellors, an admiral, a Lord Chamberlain,
and so forth, place their chairs in a row, and detaching
from the back of each seat a musical instrument, turn themselves
into a St. James's ("Hall" not "Court") Christy Minstrel Company,
Unlimited, of which Mr. <span class="sc">Barrington</span>, as the <i>Mr. Johnson</i>, is the
life and soul. Is this the remarkably original creation of the united
intellects of Messrs. <span class="sc">Gilbert</span> and <span class="sc">Sullivan</span>? Have they ever
heard of, or did either of them ever see a burlesque entitled <i>Black
Eye'd Susan</i> at the Royalty, which ran a long way over six hundred
nights, and in later days was revived at the Opera Comique and
elsewhere? I will quote from the <i>Times</i>' notice of that burlesque:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The court-martial arranged after the fashion of the Christy's orchestra,
every admiral being dressed in a colour corresponding to his title, an actual
'nigger' figuring as Admiral of the Black, is another odd device which
keeps the audience in a roar."
</p></blockquote>

<p>And it is this "odd device," with a Lord Chancellor, if I remember
right, or some legal luminary in black, for one of the "corner
men," which is, after all is said, sung, and done, just the one thing
(of the two in the show) that brings down the house, and is
applauded to the echo as the outcome of the combined whimsical
originality of Messrs. <span class="sc">Gilbert</span> and <span class="sc">Sullivan</span>! Imitation being
the
sincerest flattery, the author of <i>Black Eye'd Susan</i> must be indeed
gratified by this tribute to his original success paid by the
librettist and the composer of <i>Utopia</i>, and having no further use
for this particular bit of humour, he will, no doubt, be willing to
make a present of it, free of charge, for nightly use, to the distinguished
Savoyards as a practical congratulation to the pair of them
on their return to the scene of some of their former triumphs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Barrington</span> is the life and soul of the show; withdraw him,
and then there would be precious little left to draw, excepting, of
course, the <i>mise en scène</i>, due to Messrs. <span class="sc">Harris</span> and
<span class="sc">Carte</span>, if I may
put the <span class="sc">Harris</span> before the <span class="sc">Carte</span>,&mdash;and to the Scenic Artist,
<span class="sc">Craven</span>. Nor must I forget to mention the Electric Lightists,
Messrs. <span class="sc">Lyons</span> and <span class="sc">Kerr</span>, which last is a queer combination of
names, from the king of the forest to the lowest of snappy dogs. Miss
<span class="sc">Rosina Brandram</span> is, of course, excellent in what she has to do, and
Miss <span class="sc">Nancy McIntosh</span> is equal to the occasion of her appearance.
<span class="sc">Percy Anderson's</span> costumes are gorgeous and artistic; and to the
"Parisian Diamond Company" are due the gems of the piece. The
dances are by the ever fertile and agile <span class="sc">D'Auban</span>, and everybody
who has contributed to the success of the show obtains honourable
mention in the neat programme-card.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
